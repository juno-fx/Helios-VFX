# Custom Logo

The Helios "Start Menu" logo can be customized by replacing the `common/root/usr/share/themes/helios-logo.png` file with your own image. This logo will be displayed in the Helios start menu and other places where the Helios logo is used.

---

# Update Default Logo

Download your favorite logo and replace the `common/root/usr/share/themes/helios-logo.png` file with your custom image. This file will be used as the default logo for all distros.

# Build the Image

To build the image with your custom logo included, you can run the following command:

```shell
make alpine-3
```

This command will build the Alpine 3 image with your custom logo. You can replace `alpine-3` with any other distro supported by Helios to build those images with your custom logo as well.
